# VideoSnapping
Personal reimplementation of VideoSnapping: interactive synchronization of multiple videos.  Note that the implementation is missing *many aspects of the paper*, including:

- Warping constraints.
- Sub frame rendering.
- Global time parameterization.
- Multiple sequences.
- Interactivity.

In addition, it is also written for the purpose of clarity, and is unoptimized and (very) slow. All code provide here is to be used for research purposes only (please refer see the included license file).
